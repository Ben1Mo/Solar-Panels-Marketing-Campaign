# Solar Panels: Marketing Campaign

In this project we would like to target a certain audience with a marketing campaign, however few key points are still there to figure out, namely, income characteristics of population, age distribution, housing types...etc.

This project is about analysing a given dataset in order to emphasize on patterns and trends that can help to have a successful and targeted campaign.

## I. Running the Jupyter-Notebook:
Following are the steps to set up the python environment and to run the Jupyter notebook.

### 1. Creating a python virtual environment:
The [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) of Python shows how to simply set up an environment for multiple operating systems.

The [following article](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/) shows how to use the virtual environment in Jupyter.

### 2. Installing packages:
To install the required packages with the correct versions a `requirements.txt` file is provided with the project, simply run the following:

```bash
source ~/path/to/vir_env/bin/activate # activate virt_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Jupyter Notebook:

To run the Jupyter notebook locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
source ~/path/to/vir_env/bin/activate # activate virt_env
jupyter-notebook solar_panel_marketing_campaign_analysis.ipynb
```
